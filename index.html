      Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and
      computer-generated animation originating from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>. Outside of Japan and
      in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1]
      However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening
      of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of
      style or origin. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to
      Japanese animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.
      The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic
      art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka
      and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
      Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly
      to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime
      are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video
      games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and
      niche audiences. Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production
      methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It
      combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of
      imaginative and individualistic techniques.[2] Compared to Western
      animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more
      on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning,
      zooming, and angle shots.[2] Diverse art styles are used, and character
      proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic
      feature being large and emotive eyes.[3] The anime industry consists of
      over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio
      Ghibli, Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio,
      CoMix Wave Films and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also
      seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed,
      subtitled programming, and since the 2010s its increasing distribution
      through streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime
      culture, both within Japan and Worldwide.[4] As of 2016, Japanese
      animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows
